      "content": "I have had the opportunity to create content and projection map large scale buildings for both live music productions and corporate clients. With projection mapping, every project brings a very different set of challenges; ambient light, projector placements (avoiding things like shadows) or hard to work with structural elements to name a few. When working on a projection mapping project, my primary motivator is transforming the space into something the viewers would never expect. Whether its using “invisible” lights, adding structural elements, or simply adding abstract design to highlight different areas, every project is approached with the unique space and facade in mind."

Without any preview of the music that would be performed, I was tasked with creating a full 75 minute show that incorporated projection mapping of the entire facade as well as a large center screen. The entire projection surface was over 250 feet wide, utilizing six 40k lumen projectors. Using a mixture of pre-rendered and generative sources, I worked with Theron Pray to mix content in real-time on the facade and the center screen, live to the music.",

Additionally, the proximity of the stage piece to a lower LED wall offered a unique chance to either separate the elements with two distinct visuals, or to unify them and create one cohesive shape.",
